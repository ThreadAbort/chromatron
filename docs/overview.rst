Chromatron is an open source Wifi pixel controller. It is a complete hardware and software toolkit designed specifically for making projects with LED pixel strips.


Chromatron began life as a `Kickstarter project <https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1286098094/chromatron-wifi-pixel-controller>`_, which is still an excellent place to see what this project is all about.  You can also find more information `here <http://chromatron.io/>`_.
