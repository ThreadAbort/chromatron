Getting Started
===============


Resources for beginners
-----------------------

If this is your first time doing an LED project, you can do no better than Adafruit's excellent getting started guides:

`Adafruit NeoPixel Ãœberguide <https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide>`_

`Adafruit DotStar LEDs <https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dotstar-leds>`_

While you're there, please consider picking up your first set of LEDs from them.  You can absolutely find LEDs cheaper elsewhere on the Internet, but Adafruit helps enable projects like Chromatron to exist by the sheer volume of information, guides, and enthusiasm they create.  The Maker community thrives on the good will of its members.
